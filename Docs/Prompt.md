## Microservies
Iâ€™m a beginner in Docker and microservices, studying both to scale and enhance my Node.js application. My goal is to implement a small-scale microservices architecture (2-3 services) while adhering to industry best practices. I want to learn the core principles of microservices, different communication patterns, and the basics of message brokers such as message queuing, routing, and delivery. Additionally, I aim to familiarize myself with both Docker and Kubernetes within a week, dockerize my first project, push it to Docker Hub, and then deploy it using Kubernetes. Please provide me with a comprehensive, hands-on study plan and best practices to achieve this.
